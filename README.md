# Bulk-Folder-and-File-Organizer

## Description
This script helps organize a collection of images into a desired folder structure. It creates main folders and subfolders based on the user's input, allowing for flexibility and customization.

The purpose of this script is to facilitate the organization of images into a structured folder hierarchy. Users can adjust the script to their specific needs, such as creating different main folders, subfolders, or changing the number of images per subfolder.

## Features
- Creates main folders based on user input.
- Creates subfolders within each main folder based on user input.
- Distributes a specified number of images to each subfolder.
- Provides a clean and organized arrangement for the collection of images.


## Usage
1. Place the script in the same directory as the images you want to organize.
2. Modify the script to set the desired folder names and numbers, if needed.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python image_organizer.py`).
4. Check the output to verify that the images have been copied successfully to the subfolders.

Please note: This code assumes the images are in JPEG format and have the `.jpg` extension. Modify the code if your image files have a different extension.

## Example
To organize a collection of 200 images into 4 main folders, each containing 5 subfolders with 10 images in each subfolder, you can modify the script accordingly.
